    longDescription: >
      This app provides a generic integration engine 
      for OIDC providers. It provides a way to connect
      any oidc account to Nextcloud.

      It works by running the oidc auth flow for a user,
      including getting consent, against any oidc provider
      and collects a refersh token that is used to
      periodically refesh access tokens allowing other
      apps to use them for integration, such as email
      sync, calendar sync or anything else.
